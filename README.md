# Hang The Man!!

Just a C++ project I did during my first semester at college. Basically my first coding experience. Lol.

This is a simple hangman game written in C++. There are two players mode, 1 player mode - a player needs to guess the word and 2 players mode - player 1 type in the word and player 2 have to guess the word. You get 4 chances per word, and if all 4 chances is up, you're dead muahahaha.

To start, click on main.exe. *But you already know that.*
